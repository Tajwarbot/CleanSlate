# CleanSlate — Master Project Status & Context Document

> **Notice for Future AI Agents**: Read this document first! It provides complete context on CleanSlate's architecture, current implementation progress, objective, and next steps.

## 🎯 Master Objective
**CleanSlate** is a professional, privacy-first, open-source browser extension (Manifest V3) that helps users manage and remove their own Facebook and Messenger activity through normal browser interfaces without using external APIs or requiring user credentials.

### Key Core Principles
1. **Local & Privacy-First**: 100% client-side execution. Zero external telemetry, tracking, or remote servers.
2. **Defensive & Rate-Limited**: Built-in human-like delays, safety circuit breakers, and automatic security challenge (CAPTCHA/checkpoint) detection.
3. **Fail-Closed State Machine**: Operation states strictly governed by a deterministic state machine.
4. **Resilient DOM Layering**: Uses accessible names (`aria-label`, `role`), semantic attributes, and structural fallbacks to withstand Facebook UI updates.
